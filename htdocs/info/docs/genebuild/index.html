<h1>Gene annotation in VectorBase</h1>

<h2>Main genebuild</h2>

<p>
Data in VectorBase comes from a variety of sources; in some cases, genes are built by collaborators; in some cases, we are actively 
involved ourselves in an <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/genebuild/index.html">Ensembl-style genebuild process</a>; and 
then merged with those produced from the sequencing centres.
</p>
<p>See the homepage for each species or collection for more information about how genes in this data set have been built.
